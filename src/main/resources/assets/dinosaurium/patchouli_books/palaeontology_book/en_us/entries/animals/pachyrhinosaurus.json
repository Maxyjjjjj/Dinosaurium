            "text": "Pachyrhinosaurus was a distinctive ceratopsian dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Period, specifically found in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, Canada, and the North Slope of Alaska. Unlike other ceratopsians, it uniquely featured a thick, bony boss (or 'pad') on its snout instead of traditional horns. This pachyrhinosaur lived approximately 72-68 million years ago during the Campanian stage. As a large herbivorous quadrupedal dinosaur, it likely used its robust skull structure for intraspecific combat and defense against predators. Belonging to the Centrosaurinae subfamily of Ceratopsidae, Pachyrhinosaurus represents a fascinating example of ceratopsian morphological adaptation and regional diversity."

It was a large, carnivorous mammal that likely fed on small dinosaurs and other animals. Repenomamus is known from several species, the largest of which was Repenomamus giganticus, which was about the size of a badger. It is one of the largest known Mesozoic mammals and represents an important example of early mammalian diversity."

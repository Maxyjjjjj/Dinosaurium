It was discovered in the Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China, and is known from several well-preserved specimens. Jeholopterus was a small, insect-eating pterosaur with a wingspan of around 60 centimeters. It had a unique, bat-like wing structure, with elongated fingers and a membrane of skin stretched between them. Jeholopterus likely hunted insects at night, using its keen eyesight and sharp teeth to catch prey."

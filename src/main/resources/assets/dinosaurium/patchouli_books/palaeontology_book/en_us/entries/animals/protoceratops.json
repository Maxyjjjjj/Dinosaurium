It was a small, quadrupedal herbivore that reached lengths of around 1.8 meters (6 feet) and weighed up to 400 kilograms (880 pounds). Protoceratops was characterized by its parrot-like beak, frill-less skull, and a small, bony neck frill that likely served as a display structure or for species recognition."

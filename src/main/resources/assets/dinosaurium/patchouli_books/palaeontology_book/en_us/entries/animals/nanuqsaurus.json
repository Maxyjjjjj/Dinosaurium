            "text": "Nanuqsaurus was a genus of tyrannosaurid dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous Period (approximately 70-69 million years ago) in what is now Alaska, United States. It was characterized by its small size, reaching around 6-7 meters (20-23 feet) in length, and its unique adaptations to the cold, polar environment in which it lived. Nanuqsaurus is known from a partial skull and other skeletal remains, which suggest that it was a close relative of the larger, more well-known tyrannosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus rex. It represents an important example of the diversity of tyrannosaurids during the Late Cretaceous."

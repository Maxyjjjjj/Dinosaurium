            "text": "Magyarosaurus was a titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur endemic to the Ha»õeg Island in the Late Cretaceous Period (approximately 70-66 million years ago). As a member of the dwarf sauropod fauna characteristic of this insular environment, Magyarosaurus was notably smaller than continental sauropods, reaching approximately 6 meters (20 feet) in length. Its reduced size was likely an evolutionary adaptation to limited island resources, a phenomenon known as insular dwarfism. The species possessed robust, shortened limbs and specialized dental morphology adapted for processing vegetation in its restricted habitat."

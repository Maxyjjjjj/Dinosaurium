            "text": "Nigersaurus was a genus of rebbachisaurid sauropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous Period (approximately 115-105 million years ago) in what is now Niger. It was characterized by its unusually wide, straight-edged muzzle filled with over 500 replaceable teeth, and is notable for being one of the few dinosaurs with a skull adapted for grazing at ground level. The genus reached around 9 meters (30 feet) in length and was distinguished by its relatively short neck for a sauropod, specialized vertebrae, and broad muzzle containing batteries of teeth."

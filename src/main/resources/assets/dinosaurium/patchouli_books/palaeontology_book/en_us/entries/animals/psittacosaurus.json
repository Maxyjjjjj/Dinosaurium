It was characterized by its parrot-like beak, which it used to strip leaves and branches from plants. Psittacosaurus was a small, bipedal dinosaur that likely fed on low-lying vegetation and insects. It belongs to the family Psittacosauridae and represents an important example of early ceratopsian diversity."

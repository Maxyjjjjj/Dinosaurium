Known for its distinctive flamingo-like feeding mechanism, it possessed over 1,000 thin, closely-packed teeth adapted for filter-feeding in shallow marine and freshwater environments. Its elongated, downward-curved beak and specialized dentition suggest it sieved small aquatic organisms like crustaceans and plankton, making it an exceptional example of pterosaur dietary adaptation."

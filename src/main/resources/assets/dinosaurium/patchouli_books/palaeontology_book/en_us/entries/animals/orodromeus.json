Growing up to 2 meters in length, this herbivorous dinosaur was characterized by its long legs and tail, which helped it to run quickly to escape predators. Orodromeus lived in herds and was a social animal, communicating with other members of its species through vocalizations and body language. Fossil remains have been found in North America, particularly in the state of Montana."

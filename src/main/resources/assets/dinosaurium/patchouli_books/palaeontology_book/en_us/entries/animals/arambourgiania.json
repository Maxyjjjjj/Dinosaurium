With an estimated wingspan of 10-11 meters, it was one of the largest flying animals ever known. Its most distinctive feature was its extremely long neck, which could reach up to 3 meters in length. The creature likely used its height and long neck to hunt prey from a giraffe-like stance, feeding on small animals and possibly young dinosaurs."

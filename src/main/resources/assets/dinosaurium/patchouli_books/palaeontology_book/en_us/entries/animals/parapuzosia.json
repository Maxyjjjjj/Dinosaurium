Growing up to 2 meters in diameter, this prehistoric cephalopod was characterized by its distinctive coiled shell and tentacles. Parapuzosia inhabited warm, shallow seas and was a predator, feeding primarily on small fish and crustaceans. Fossil remains have been found in various locations around the world, including North America, Europe, and Africa."

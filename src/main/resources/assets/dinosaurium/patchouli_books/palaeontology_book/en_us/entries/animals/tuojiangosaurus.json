It was characterized by its distinctive rows of plates and spikes along its back, which served as protection against predators and for display purposes. Tuojiangosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur that likely fed on low-lying vegetation, using its beak-like mouth to strip leaves and branches. It belongs to the family Stegosauridae and represents an important example of stegosaur diversity."

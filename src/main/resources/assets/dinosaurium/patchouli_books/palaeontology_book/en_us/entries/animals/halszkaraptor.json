It was discovered in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, and is known from a single, well-preserved skeleton. Halszkaraptor was a small, bird-like dinosaur with a long neck, sharp teeth, and a unique semiaquatic lifestyle. It likely hunted fish and small animals in the water, using its long neck and sharp teeth to catch prey."

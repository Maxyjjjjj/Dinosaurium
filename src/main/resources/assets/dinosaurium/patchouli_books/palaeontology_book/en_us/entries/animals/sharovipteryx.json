Discovered in Kyrgyzstan, Sharovipteryx is known for its unique adaptations for aerial locomotion, including elongated forelimbs with skin membranes that allowed it to glide between trees. With a wingspan of around 25 centimeters and a body length of 30 centimeters, Sharovipteryx was likely an arboreal species that used its gliding abilities to escape predators and find food in forested environments."

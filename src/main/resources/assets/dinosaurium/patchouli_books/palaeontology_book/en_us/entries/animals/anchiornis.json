Discovered in China, Anchiornis is known for its well-preserved fossil specimens that provide valuable insights into the evolution of feathers and flight in theropod dinosaurs. With a body length of around 50 centimeters and a wingspan of 60-70 centimeters, Anchiornis was likely an arboreal species that used its feathered limbs for gliding and climbing in forested environments."

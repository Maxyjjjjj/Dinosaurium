Known from fossils found in Romania, it was one of the largest flying animals ever known, with a wingspan estimated at 10-12 meters. Unlike most pterosaurs, Hatzegopteryx had an unusually short, thick neck and robust skull, suggesting it was a powerful predator capable of hunting large prey. Its remains were found in what was then an island environment, where it likely served as the apex predator."

Dated to approximately 210 million years ago, this dicynodont exhibited unique anatomical features, including an upright posture more similar to modern mammals than earlier synapsids. Its fossil remains provide critical insights into the evolutionary transition of terrestrial vertebrates during the late Triassic period."        },

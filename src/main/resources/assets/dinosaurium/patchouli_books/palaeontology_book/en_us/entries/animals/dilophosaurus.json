It had a pair of thin, bony crests on its head, which may have been used for display or to help it cool off. Dilophosaurus was a fast and agile predator, using its sharp teeth and claws to catch small animals. Fossil remains of Dilophosaurus have been found in the Kayenta Formation of Arizona and Utah."

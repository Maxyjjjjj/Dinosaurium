Despite its fish-like appearance, it was not related to fish but rather evolved from land-dwelling reptiles. Ichthyosaurus had a dolphin-like body with four flippers, a dorsal fin, and a vertical tail fluke. It possessed large eyes for hunting in deep or murky waters and a pointed snout filled with numerous sharp teeth, which it used to catch fish, squid, and other marine creatures. Most species were moderate in size, typically 2-3 meters in length."

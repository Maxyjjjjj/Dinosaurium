As a member of the Dsungaripteridae family, it possessed a distinctive upturned beak and likely specialized in feeding on hard-shelled invertebrates like mollusks. With a wingspan estimated around 3-4 meters, Dsungaripterus was a medium-sized pterosaur adapted for aerial hunting and foraging in coastal and inland environments."

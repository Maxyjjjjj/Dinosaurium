            "text": "Archaeopteryx was a genus of bird-like dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic Period, approximately 150.8-148.5 million years ago, in what is now Germany. It was characterized by its combination of bird-like and dinosaur-like features, such as feathers, wings, and a long, bony tail. Archaeopteryx is considered one of the earliest and most primitive birds, representing a transitional form between non-avian dinosaurs and modern birds. It was a small, carnivorous dinosaur that likely fed on insects, small vertebrates, and other prey."

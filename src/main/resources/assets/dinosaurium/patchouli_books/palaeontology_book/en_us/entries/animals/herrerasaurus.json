Discovered in Argentina, Herrerasaurus is one of the oldest known dinosaurs and represents an important stage in the evolution of dinosaurs. With a length of around 3-4 meters and a bipedal stance, Herrerasaurus was a carnivorous predator that likely hunted small to medium-sized prey in its arid, semi-desert environment."

It was one of the earliest dinosaurs, and its fossils have been found in North America, particularly in the Chinle Formation of Arizona and New Mexico. Coelophysis was a bipedal dinosaur with a slender body, long tail, and sharp teeth. It likely hunted small animals and insects, using its speed and agility to catch prey."

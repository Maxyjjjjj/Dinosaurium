It was the largest known predator of its time, and is one of the most well-known dinosaurs. It was about 12.9 meters long and weighed about 7,000 kilograms. Tyrannosaurus had a large, heavy skull with a large, serrated dentary bone that was used to crush the bones of its prey. It had a long, muscular tail used for balance, and two long, sickle-shaped claws on each hind limb. It was covered in feathers, which were probably used for insulation."
